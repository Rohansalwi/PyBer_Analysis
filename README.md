# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
This project is to analyze data for budget spent on the students from 15 different schools on the scores of Math and Reading from grades 9th to 12th.

## Results
The challenge was that after analyzing the data it was reported that the data for the 9th grade students from Thomas High School was erroneous. This challenge was overcome by replacing that data with null values and re-analyzing it.

## Summary
With the removal of erroneous data from Thomas high school for 9th grade, the math and reading scores are slightly reduced by around 0.1
