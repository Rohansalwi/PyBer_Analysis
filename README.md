# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
This project is to analyze data for PyBer from Jan 2019 to May 2019 for various cities categorized as Urban, Suburban and Rural. The data contains cities, date, the type of city and the number of PyBer drivers in that city, the ride id and the fare for that ride. I have used this information to find which city type has the maximum number of rides, fares and drivers. 

## Results
Based on the data and the graphs, maximum rides are taken in the urban area which contributes 68.42% of the total rides taken. Suburban contributes 26.31% and Rural 5.26%. As a result the fare contribution of Urban type is also higher than the rural and suburban combined.

## Summary
As per the summary the number of drivers in rural area are the lowest forming only 2.6% of the total drivers thus affecting the number of rides and revenue.
To address this descrepency, following measures can be taken.
1. Encourage more drivers to join PyBer in rural and suburban areas by introducing lucrative schemes.
2. Special fares for customers in rural and suburban city types to encourage them to choose PyBer over other ride sharing services. This will increase the rides and finally the revenue.
3. Introduce more interconnecting city rides for customers to choose from.
